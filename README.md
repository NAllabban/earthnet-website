# The Star System

Have you ever watched a movie because an actor was starring in it? Good actors lead to good movies. The star system has started in Hollywood in the 1920s with the goal of exploiting the image of actors to promote movies and generate publicity. The project aims at quantifying the impact of actors on the movie success and its variation along their career, through the definition of a 'star score' metric associated with profit and movie ratings. The success of the movie may not only rely on the experience of the actors and their score, but it may also depend on the gender distribution in the cast. The coupling of these factors can express the benefit of choosing one actor over another one, and which genre he/she is most suitable for. Through a regression model it will be possible to predict the success of a future movie depending on its actors. A further step will be to generate star scores for directors and writers and verify their influence on the movies' positive outcome.
