# Introduction

Have you ever watched a movie because an actor was starring in it? Good actors lead to good movies. The star system has started in Hollywood in the 1920s with the goal of exploiting the image of actors to promote movies and generate publicity. The project, based on the movies released in the US, aims at investigating the factors that make an actor successful. Successful actors are able to make a living out of their acting career, and even if this seems normal for any other job, in the movie industry, a huge part of the actors' population are 'one-hit wonders', actors that starred only once and did not manage to make their career take off. A minority of the actors, instead, detains most of the assigned jobs, generating a natural power law in actors' movie appearances. How do these different categories of actors impact the ratings of the movies they star in? An observational study is carried out, in order to understand and limit the confounders affecting this mechanism of joining the 'richer' circle.
